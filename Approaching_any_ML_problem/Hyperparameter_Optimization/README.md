OPTIMIZATION
==
Optimization basically means tuning the nuts and bolts of a machine learning or deep learning model
inorder to get the best possible results from the provided data.

Optimizing deep neural networks is difficult but not impossible. Eg: choose a ADAM optimizer, use a 
lower learning rate, redure leanring rate on a plateau of validation loss, try some augumentation, 
try preprocessing the imagesm changing the batch size, etc.
